## Description

_{Lesson prompt:}_
_Make a web page that allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all. Here are the definitions of each possibility:_
* _Equilateral: All sides are equal._
* _Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal._
* _Scalene: No sides are equal._
* _NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side._
_Once your application is functioning correctly, try to refactor your code as much as possible._
